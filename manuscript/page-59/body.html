Agricultural districts have their towns at about eight miles, and where grazing takes the place of the plough, the town distances increase to fifteen.</p><p>A third, and almost final, factor determining town distribution in a world without railways, would be the seaport and the navigable river. Ports would grow into dimensions dependent on the population of the conveniently accessible coasts (or river-banks), and on the quality and quantity of their products, and near these ports, as the conveniences of civilization increased, would appear handicraft towns&mdash;the largest possible towns of a foot-and-horse civilization&mdash;with industries of such a nature as the produce of their coasts required.</p></div> </div>
