<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But though most great cities are probably still very far from their maxima, though the network of feeding railways has still to spread over Africa and China, and though huge areas are still imperfectly productive for want of a cultivating population, yet it is well to remember that for each great city, quite irrespective of its available spaces, a maximum of population is fixed. Each great city is sustained finally by the trade and production of a certain proportion of the world's surface&mdash;by the area it commands commercially. The great city cannot grow, except as a result of some quite morbid and transitory process&mdash;to be cured at last by famine and disorder&mdash;beyond the limit the commercial capacity of that commanded area prescribes. Long before the population of this city, with its inner circle a third of the area of Belgium, rose towards the old-fashioned city density, this restriction would come in.</p></div> </div>
