<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>These are two highly probably m&eacute;nages among the central mass of the people of the coming time. But there will be many others. The m&eacute;nage &agrave; deux, one may remark, though it may be without the presence of children, is not necessarily childless. Parentage is certainly part of the pride of many men&mdash;though, curiously enough, it does not appear to be felt among modern European married women as any part of their honour. Many men will probably achieve parentage, therefore, who will not succeed in inducing, or who may possibly even be very loth to permit, their wives to undertake more than the first beginnings of motherhood. From the moment of its birth, unless it is kept as a pet, the child of such marriages will be nourished, taught, and trained almost as though it were an orphan, it will have a succession of bottles and foster-mothers for body and mind from the very beginning.</p></div> </div>
