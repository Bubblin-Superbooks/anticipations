One combatant, perhaps, will heel lamely earthward, dropping, dropping, with half its bladders burst or shot away, the other circles down in pursuit.... "What are they doing?" Our marksmen will snatch at their field-glasses, tremulously anxious, "Is that a white flag or no?... If they drop now we have 'em!"</p><p>But the duel will be the rarer thing. In any affair of ramming there is an enormous advantage for the side that can contrive, anywhere in the field of action, to set two vessels at one. The mere ascent of one flying-ram from one side will assuredly slip the leashes of two on the other, until the man&oelig;uvring squadrons may be as thick as starlings in October. They will wheel and mount, they will spread and close, there will be elaborate man&oelig;uvres for the advantage of the wind, there will be sudden drops to the shelter of entrenched guns.</p></div> </div>
