Throughout America, in England, and, after extraordinary experiments, in France, political democracy has in effect legally established itself&mdash;most completely in the United States&mdash;and the reflection and influence of its methods upon the methods of all the other countries in intellectual contact with it, have been so considerable as practically to make their monarchies as new in their kind, almost, as democratic republics. In Germany, Austria, and Italy, for example, there is a press nearly as audible as in the more frankly democratic countries, and measurably akin in influence;</p></div> </div>
