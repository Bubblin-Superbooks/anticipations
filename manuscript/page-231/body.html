<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Everywhere there were new elements, not as yet clearly analyzed or defined, arising as mechanism arose; everywhere the old traditional government and social system, defined and analyzed all too well, appeared increasingly obstructive, irrational, and feeble in its attempts to include and direct these new powers. But now comes a point to which I am inclined to attach very great importance. The new powers were as yet shapeless. It was not the conflict of a new organization with the old. It was the preliminary dwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new. It was impossible then&mdash;it is, I believe, only beginning to be possible now&mdash;to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years.</p></div> </div>
