<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The present conditions of book production for the English reading public offer no hope of any immediate change in this respect. There is neither honour nor reward&mdash;there is not even food or shelter&mdash;for the American or Englishman who devotes a year or so of his life to the adequate treatment of any spacious question, and so small is the English reading public with any special interest in science, that a great number of important foreign scientific works are never translated into English at all. Such interesting compilations as Bloch's work on war, for example, must be read in French; in English only a brief summary of his results is to be obtained, under a sensational heading.</p><p>These things, if they were merely the grievances of the study, might very well rest there.</p></div> </div>
