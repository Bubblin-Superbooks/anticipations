Not for want of a crowning intellect, for none of the many minds concerned in the development strikes one&mdash;as the mind of Newton, Shakespeare, or Darwin strikes one&mdash;as being that of an unprecedented man. It is not that the need for the railway and steam engine had only just arisen, and&mdash;to use one of the most egregiously wrong and misleading phrases that ever dropped from the lips of man&mdash;the demand created the supply; it was quite the other way about. There was really no urgent demand for such things at the time; the current needs of the European world seem to have been fairly well served by coach and diligence in 1800, and, on the other hand, every administrator of intelligence in the Roman and Chinese empires must have felt an urgent need for more rapid methods of transit than those at his disposal.</p></div> </div>
