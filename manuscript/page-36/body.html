<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We may even hazard some details about these special roads. For example, they will be very different from macadamized roads; they will be used only by soft-tired conveyances; the battering horseshoes, the perpetual filth of horse traffic, and the clumsy wheels of laden carts will never wear them. It may be that they will have a surface like that of some cycle-racing tracks, though since they will be open to wind and weather, it is perhaps more probable they will be made of very good asphalt sloped to drain, and still more probable that they will be of some quite new substance altogether&mdash;whether hard or resilient is beyond my foretelling. They will have to be very wide&mdash;they will be just as wide as the courage of their promoters goes&mdash;and if the first made are too narrow there will be no question of gauge to limit the later ones.</p></div> </div>
