<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Every boundary of the ethnographical, linguistic, political, and commercial map&mdash;as a little consideration will show&mdash;has indeed been traced in the first place by the means of transit, under the compulsion of geographical contours.</p><p>There are evident in Europe four or five or more very distinct racial types, and since the methods and rewards of barbaric warfare and the nature of the chief chattels of barbaric trade have always been diametrically opposed to racial purity, their original separation could only have gone on through such an entire lack of communication as prevented either trade or warfare between the bulk of the differentiating bodies. These original racial types are now inextricably mingled. Unobservant, over-scholarly people talk or write in the profoundest manner about a Teutonic race and a Keltic race, and institute all sorts of curious contrasts between these phantoms, but these are not races at all, if physical characteristics have anything to do with race.</p></div> </div>
