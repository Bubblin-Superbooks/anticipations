And from that followed a very interesting and curious result.</p><p>These tram-lines very naturally had exactly the width of an ordinary cart, a width prescribed by the strength of one horse. Few people saw in the locomotive anything but a cheap substitute for horseflesh, or found anything incongruous in letting the dimensions of a horse determine the dimensions of an engine. It mattered nothing that from the first the passenger was ridiculously cramped, hampered, and crowded in the carriage. He had always been cramped in a coach, and it would have seemed "Utopian"&mdash;a very dreadful thing indeed to our grandparents&mdash;to propose travel without cramping. By mere inertia the horse-cart gauge, the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge, nemine contradicente, established itself in the world, and now everywhere the train is dwarfed to a scale that limits alike its comfort, power, and speed.</p></div> </div>
