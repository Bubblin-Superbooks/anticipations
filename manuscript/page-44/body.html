<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Many people living at the present time, who have grown up amidst the exceptional and possibly very transient characteristics of this time, will be disposed to regard the traffic in the streets of our great cities as a part of the natural order of things, and as unavoidable as the throng upon the pavement. But indeed the presence of all the chief constituents of this vehicular torrent&mdash;the cabs and hansoms, the vans, the omnibuses&mdash;everything, indeed, except the few private carriages&mdash;are as novel, as distinctively things of the nineteenth century, as the railway train and the needle telegraph. The streets of the great towns of antiquity, the streets of the great towns of the East, the streets of all the medi&aelig;val towns, were not intended for any sort of wheeled traffic at all&mdash;were designed primarily and chiefly for pedestrians. So it would be, I suppose, in any one's ideal city.</p></div> </div>
