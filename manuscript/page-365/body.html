<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I do not see how this great region is to unify itself without some linguistic compromise&mdash;the Germanization of the French-speaking peoples by force is too ridiculous a suggestion to entertain. Almost inevitably with travel, with transport communications, with every condition of human convenience insisting upon it, formally or informally a bi-lingual compromise will come into operation, and to my mind at least the chances seem even that French will emerge on the upper hand. Unless, indeed, that great renascence of the English-speaking peoples should, after all, so overwhelmingly occur as to force this European city to be tri-lingual, and prepare the way by which the whole world may at last speak together in one tongue.</p><p>These are the aggregating tongues. I do not think that any other tongues than these are quite likely to hold their own in the coming time.</p></div> </div>
