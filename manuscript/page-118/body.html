Such usury as was practised relied entirely on the land and the anticipated agricultural produce of the land.</p><p>But the usury and the sleeping partnerships of the Joint Stock Company system which took shape in the eighteenth and the earlier half of the nineteenth century opened quite unprecedented uses for money, and created a practically new sort of property and a new proprietor class.
