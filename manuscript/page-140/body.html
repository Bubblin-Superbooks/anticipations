<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>big men and little men, indeed, but with no dividing lines&mdash;of more or less expert mechanics and engineers, with a certain common minimum of education and intelligence, and probably a common-class consciousness&mdash;a new body, a new force, in the world's history.</p><p>For this body to exist implies the existence of much more than the primary and initiating nucleus of engineers and skilled mechanics. If it is an educated class, its existence implies a class of educators, and just as far as it does get educated the schoolmasters will be skilled and educated men. The shabby-genteel middle-class schoolmaster of the England of to-day, in&mdash;or a little way out of&mdash;orders, with his smattering of Greek, his Latin that leads nowhere, his fatuous mathematics, his gross ignorance of pedagogics, and his incomparable snobbishness, certainly does not represent the schoolmaster of this coming class.</p></div> </div>
