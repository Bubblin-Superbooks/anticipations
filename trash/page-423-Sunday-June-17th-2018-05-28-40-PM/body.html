And in particular, there are certain broad questions much under discussion to which, thus far, I have purposely given a value disproportionately small:&mdash;</p><p>While the New Republic is gathering itself together and becoming aware of itself, that other great element, which I have called the People of the Abyss, will also have followed out its destiny. For many decades that development will be largely or entirely out of all human control.</p></div> </div>
